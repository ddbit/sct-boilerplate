<p>You might be surprised but yes, everyone can launch a ICO (Initial Coin Offering) for even the smallest business. Here am I. I need to get some money to refurbish a portion of my property and transform it in a cozy and nice place to welcome BnB guests from all around the world. How to get this money though?</p>
<h2>Here the Idea</h2>
<p>Lets sell the BnB days even before the refurbishment is done, it is a presale and if you are interested it works as explained below in the mythical Pink Paper.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Pink Paper (starts here)</h2>
<h3>The Location.</h3>
<p>The property is a large detached house in a super cool location. Few km from the center of Cagliari and close to many beaches and beautiful landscapes. You'll find a beach at 400mt, another great beach at 5 minutes cycling, a number of superb beaches at 10 minutes driving, including Poetto on one side and Mari Pintau and Cala e Moru on the opposite one. Cagliari is 20 minute driving for you to enjoy the beauty of the city and the nightly movida (thanks to the Sindaco Massimo Zedda).</p>
<h3>The Property.</h3>
<p>The House is my family house, however it is large enough and get a new studio flat to accomodate two guests. Here the current state of the building and how we mean to transform it.</p>

<h3>The Roadmap.</h3>
<p>Q4 2017 The team (me and Family) will apply to get the necessary clearance and license from the local council</p>
<p>EoY 2017 The ICO will start</p>
<p>Q2 2018 Start of refurbishment.</p>
<p>Q3 2018 First guest coming and enjoying the space</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The BNB Token</h3>
<p>The Token will be a ERC20 compliant Ethereum token named "MyHouseBnB" and with code 'BNB'.</p>
<p>The Token sale will start ....</p>
<p>The circulating supply will be capped at 2,000 token</p>
<p>Each token will cost approx. 25€ or 0.1 ether at the current rate (it might be changed just before the launch to get an adjusted rate)</p>
<p>What rights come with tokens? A calendar will be published soon and split into three main parts: off peak, half peak, peak time. The token can be redeemed as follows</p>
<p>5-day booking per person in off peak time = 5 BNB</p>
<p>5-day booking per person in half peak time = 7,5 BNB</p>
<p>5-day booking per person in peak time = 10 BNB</p>
<p>No reedem is allowed for bookings shorter than 5 days. 5 days is the minimum booking allowed (<strong>buying at least 5 BNB is strongly suggested</strong>)</p>
