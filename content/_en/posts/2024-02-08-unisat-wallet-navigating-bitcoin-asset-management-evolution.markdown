## What is Unisat Wallet?

Unisat Wallet is an open-source Chrome extension that facilitates the use of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens on the Bitcoin network. Ordinals, a protocol that allows for the creation of unique digital artifacts by marking satoshis, and BRC-20, a token standard similar to Ethereum's ERC-20 but for Bitcoin, represent a new frontier for Bitcoin's utility. Unisat Wallet simplifies the interaction with these assets, allowing users to create, store, and transfer NFT Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens without the need to run a full node.

## Unique Features

The wallet boasts several unique features that set it apart from other cryptocurrency wallets:

- **Ease of Use:** Designed as a Chrome extension, it integrates seamlessly into the user's browser, providing a user-friendly interface for managing Bitcoin-based assets.
- **Support for Ordinals and BRC-20 Tokens:** Unisat Wallet supports the creation, storage, and transfer of NFT Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, enabling users to engage with the Bitcoin network's evolving asset ecosystem.
- **Marketplace Integration:** An experimental marketplace feature allows for the decentralized buying and selling of BRC-20 tokens, though it's advised to proceed with caution due to its experimental nature.

## Platforms/OS Compatibility

As a Chrome extension, Unisat Wallet is compatible with any operating system that supports the Chrome browser, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This broad compatibility ensures that a wide range of users can access the wallet's features without being limited by their choice of hardware or software.

## Sending/Receiving Assets on Bitcoin Network

The process of sending and receiving assets on the Bitcoin network using Unisat Wallet is designed to be as straightforward as traditional Bitcoin transactions. Users can send and receive NFT Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens directly through the wallet interface, with the transactions being recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain.

- **Protect Your Secret Recovery Phrase:** Your wallet's security hinges on the confidentiality of your 12-word Secret Recovery Phrase, which should never be shared with anyone. This phrase provides access to your wallet and should be kept secure.

- **Utilize Security Features on Discord:** Given the rise of scammers targeting users on platforms like Discord, Unisat Wallet recommends adjusting privacy settings, enabling 2-Factor Authentication (2FA), and verifying user identities to enhance safety.
